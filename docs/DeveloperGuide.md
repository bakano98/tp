### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.  
Furthermore, `AddWindow` and `EditWindow` keeps a reference to `MainWindow`'s `Logic` component in order to execute commands.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.


### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions from the `Logic` component for the `execute("add")`
![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `add` Command](images/AddNoParamsSequenceDiagram.png)

This opens up a `AddWindow`. The execution essentially stops there, and waits for further user input.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AddCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Module` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Module` object per unique module, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Module` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.
<br /><br />
### Add Modules Feature
#### Implementation

The add modules mechanism is facilitated by `AddModuleCommand`. Its functionality is implemented in the `AddModuleCommand.java` class which follows the `Command` interface. It extends `Command` with a list of modules `List<Module>` that is to be added to an existing person, as well as the index of the person to add the modules to, stored internally as `modulesToAdd` and `targetIndex` respectively.

Additionally, it implements the following operations: 
* `Command#execute(Model model)` - Returns the feedback message containing information about module(s) added to a target person, for eventual displays in the GUI.
* `createEditedPerson(Person personToEdit, List<Module> modulesToAdd)` - Creates and returns a Person with `modulesToAdd` added to the existing details of `personToEdit`.
* `hasModulesInCommon(Person personToEdit, List<Module> proposedModules)` - Returns true if `personToEdit` contains any modules in `proposedModules`.
* `getNewModules(Person personToEdit, List<Module> proposedModules)` - Returns List of non-duplicated modules, which may be empty if no unique modules exist.
* `getCommandResult(...)` - Returns a `CommandResult` with the appropriate feedback depending on if any new modules are added.

Below is a sequence diagram showing the overview of how add modules works:

![AddModuleSequenceDiagram](images/AddModuleSequenceDiagram.png)

Each `Person` has a `Set<Module>` that represents the Collection of `Modules` associated with that `Person`.
Hence, we utilize the behaviour of the `Set` data structure to both store and add modules to a person, automatically adding any new unique Modules while ignoring Modules that already exist, without requiring any further duplicate-checking on our part.

While this underlying implementation works, we need to capture exactly what new modules were added on top of existing modules, so that we can display a meaningful feedback to our user.
This can be achieved using the `hasNewModules()` and `getNewModules()` internal helper functions.

`getCommandResult()` of `execute()` utilizes these helper functions to create a `CommandResult` object containing varied feedback messages depending on the following possibilities:
1. Case 1: Modules from user input contain only new modules
   * Shows new modules added
2. Case 2: Modules from user input contain some new modules
   * Shows new modules added, with warning that some modules already exist
3. Case 3: Modules from user input contain no new modules
   * Shows warning that modules already exist, no new modules added, along with list of existing modules (to show the user that despite the "error", no further actions associated with typical failed commands need to be taken)
     <br /><br />
### Sort feature
#### Implementation

The sort mechanism is facilitated by `PersonComparator`. It compares `Person` objects and stores internally the **list of fields** to be ordered on as well as the **order** on each field ("ascending" vs "descending"). 
`PersonComparator` then is passed to `Model`.

Within Model component, 'Model' then passes it into `AddressBook`, and which is then passed into `UniquePersonList` and finally to `ObservableList`. `ObservableList` then sorts itself based on the comparator.

Below is a sequence diagram showing how sort operation works:

![SortSequenceDiagram](images/SortSequenceDiagram.png)

Within the `PersonComparator`, it compares both persons based on the first field in the **list of fields**. If they are not equivalent, it returns the result of the comparison taking into account the **order**. 
Else, it will check the next field. When there are no fields remaining, it specifies that the two persons are equivalent.

### Alternatives
#### Aspect: How to compare: `Comparator` vs `Comparable`
####1. Alternative 1 (Current)
Each field implements a `Comparable` interface.
- Pros:
    - Easier to implement.
- Cons:
    - Less flexible.
    - Passes only one `PersonComparator` into `Model`, which stores list of fields to be sorted on. 

####2. Alternative 2
Create a comparator for `Person` for each specific field to compare on and how to compare that field. Choose a list of comparators and sort model on them one by one.
- Pros: 
  - More flexibility for ways to compare each field. E.g. can compare`Module` field based on number of modules, lexicographic ordering, etc.
- Cons: 
  - More complexity for user syntax. 
  - Less encapsulation as `PersonComparator` has to know the details of `Person` fields and how it desires to sort them. 
  - Has to pass all `PersonComparator` that were chosen into `Model` one after another so less efficient.
<br /><br />

### Comment feature
#### Implementation

The comment mechanism is facilitated by `CommentCommand`. It adds a field of type `Comment` to a `Person` object. 
The `CommentCommand.java` class extends `Command` with the index of the person to add the module to and also a 
`Comment` object which holds the comment that will be given to the person. Additionally, it implements the following 
operations:
* `Command#execute(Model model)` - Returns a message that informs users on the comment that was added to the 
  specific person. 
* `generateSuccessMessage(Person personToEdit)` - Creates and returns the message that informs users if a new comment 
  was added or deleted from `personToEdit`.

Below is a sequence diagram showing how comment operation works:

![CommentSequenceDiagram](images/CommentSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations
##### Aspect: How to remove a comment 
#####1. Alternative 1 (Current choice)
Similar to how `Status` was implemented, upon user input of an empty comment (i.e `comment 1 c/`), the comment of the 
person at the particular index, in this case the first person, will be removed.
- Pros: 
  - Can contain all logic related to adding and removing a `comment` all in the `CommentCommand` and 
    `CommentCommandParser` classes. 
  - Does not give the users too many commands to remember.
  - Avoid potential problems where users/reviewers expect a designated delete command for all fields, when some fields 
    cannot be just simply deleted on its own, e.g. address, name etc.
- Cons: 
  - Not consistent with how the other fields like `Module` and `Person` are removed. 
  
####2. Alternative 2 
Implement a separate command to handle the removal of `comment`.
- Pros: 
  - An empty comment command (`comment 1`) will show an error message, which is more intuitive.
- Cons: 
  - Results in excessive code duplication, as `delete` and `deletemodule` are implemented in a very similar way 
    to how a proposed `deletecomment` command will be implemented.
    <br /><br />

### GUI for Adding, Editing

#### Implementation

The GUI for `AddWindow` and `EditWindow` are done using JavaFX with SceneBuilder.  
The adding and editing mechanism is driven by the CLI commands, `add` and `edit`, and both goes through their respective `Parser`

Step 1: User input is retrieved from its respective `TextField`.  

Step 2: User input is strung together to follow the proper `Command` format, which is then passed to `Logic` to handle 
the rest of the execution.  

Step 3: `AddWindow` allows for the execution of multiple commands within a single window. Executing multiple 
commands (`status`, `comment`, `addmodule`) is done by checking if the given inputs are valid. 

Step 4: If they are valid, we pass the execution to `Logic` to handle the adding of a `Person`. 

Step 5: After a `Person` is added, retrieve the last index from `PersonList`, then pass the user inputs for `status`, `comment`, and/or `addmodule` into `Logic` again to execute the commands

The following activity diagram shows how a `Person` with `Status` and `Module` is added when the given command is `add` or when the user opens `AddWindow`
![GuiAddActivityDiagram](images/GuiAddActivityDiagram.png)

Editing through `EditWindow` is largely similar to the above.
<br /><br />

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
